My solutions to Advent of Code 2022

I will be using TypeScript/JavaScript/NodeJS mostly

Most of these will be the initial submission, before any refactoring.

## Setup and running code

### CLI

- `yarn`

- run `npm link`

- create .env file and add the `AOC_SESSION` variable - can be found by logging into the adventofcode website, then checking cookies for the session cookie and copy the value

- `aoc init` - then pass in the year and day to fetch the challenge details from the website and save to markdown and prepare template files

`yarn day -d 01` will run the day 1 files. will default to using the real input data (rather than test). Can pass the `-t` flag for test data - or `-r `for real input data

## The Story

Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star ⭐ fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.

To supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of fifty stars ⭐ by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star ⭐. Good luck!
